The implementaions of AMSolver, VLM, and 6D-CLIPort.

In order to use the code, you should instill [PyRep](https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep) first. Then, lets install AMSolver:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .

In the vlm folder, we have predefined some task categories and instance tasks for vlmbench dataset. If you want to customize your own task, the scripts in the tools folder can be helpful.
